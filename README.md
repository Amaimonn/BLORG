# BLORG
*A 3D voxel-based survivor game with a deadly color-matching twist!*
## Core Gameplay 
You stand against endless waves of enemies swarming toward you—just like in Vampire Survivors. But there’s a catch: every enemy has a **color**, and only the right attack color can destroy them.
- Color-Coded Combat :fire:: Hit an enemy with its matching color to defeat it.
- Dangerous Mistakes :skull:: Attack with the wrong color, and the enemy splits into two, making the horde even harder to control!
- Chaotic Strategy :star2:: Adapt on the fly, swap attack colors, and avoid accidentally multiplying your foes.
